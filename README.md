# Genetic-Algorithm-using-python
WAKA WAKA!!!
Here we see how to find a maximum value of y for given range of x for a polynomial using python.
The algorithm generates new children from the parent, the new children are mentioned as new generation.
Keep in mind to generate a valid polynomial and range.
You can change the range and the polynomial function in the code and also
the number of generations can also be altered.
